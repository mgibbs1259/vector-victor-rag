    "The FAA Order JO 7110.65 is an essential document issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) that provides comprehensive guidelines and procedures for air traffic control (ATC) operations in the United States. It is commonly referred to as the \"Air Traffic Control\" manual and serves as the primary reference for air traffic controllers. The document outlines standardized procedures for managing and directing aircraft movements both in the air and on the ground, ensuring safety and efficiency in the National Airspace System (NAS).\\n\\nThe order covers a wide range of topics, including communication protocols, separation standards, radar operations, and emergency procedures. It is regularly updated to reflect changes in technology, regulations, and best practices in air traffic management. Controllers, pilots, and other aviation professionals rely on JO 7110.65 to maintain consistent and safe operations across the aviation industry."
